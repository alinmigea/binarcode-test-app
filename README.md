# BinarCode Assessment

## BE - Senior interview playground template

Prepare ahead a fresh Laravel app environment. Would be good to have Laravel Valet, or something similar so we can test right away.

Imagine youâ€™re stripe, and you want to send notifications to your customers as soon you got a new payment.

1. Create an endpoint called `api/reminders/schedule`
2. Add a custom middleware for this endpoint that checks the header `X-SCHEDULER-HEADER` to be `secret!` otherwise do not allow the request to go through
3. Create a controller and handler method
4. Validate that the request has the correct payload
    ```php
    channel - should be string, required and in the list "mail, database"
    message - should be string, required, max 256
    time - should be a date time ISO
    email - should be email and optional, required only if the "channel" is mail
    ```
5. Create a migration for a new table called `schedulers` with the columns above. Add some more status columns to the migration (`sent_at`, `failed_at`)
6. Create a model with the columns above
7. Store the request payload into the database
8. Create a scheduler command that runs hourly and checks for unsent notifications the notifications to be sent this hour. The `unsent notifications` should be filtered using a model local scope called `scopeReady` and filter them there
9. In the command check the `channel` type and send the notification using `Notification` facade
10. Create a generic mailable class that sends the email in case the channel is email. The email should be queued into the `emails` queue
11. Create a generic notification to send the notification into the database in case the channel requires that
12. Create a test using PHPUnit that ensures the notification is sent through
